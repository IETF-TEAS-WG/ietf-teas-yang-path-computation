<t>There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) context, where the topology information provided by
   a Traffic Engineering (TE) network provider may be insufficient for
   its client to perform multi-domain path computation. In these cases the
   client would need to request the TE network provider to compute some
   intra-domain paths to be used by the client to choose the optimal multi-domain paths.</t>

<t>This document provides a mechanism to request path computation by augmenting the Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) defined in RFC YYYY.</t>

<t>[RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of
   draft-ietf-teas-yang-te once it has been published.</t>

<section anchor="intro"><name>Introduction</name>

<t anchor="pc-model">There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) context, where the topology information provided by
   a Traffic Engineering (TE) network provider may be insufficient for
   its client to perform multi-domain path computation. In these cases the
   client would need to request the TE network provider to compute some
   intra-domain paths that could be used together with its topology information
   to compute the multi-domain path.</t>

<t>These types of scenarios can be applied to different interfaces in
   different reference architectures:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO) control interface
<xref target="RFC7491"/>, in which an Application Service Coordinator can request the
ABNO controller to take in charge path calculation (see Figure 1
in <xref target="RFC7491"/>).</t>
  <t>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) <xref target="RFC8453"/>, where a
controller hierarchy is defined.
In the ACTN context, path computation is needed on the interface
between Customer Network Controller (CNC)  and Multi-Domain
Service Coordinator (MDSC), called CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI),
and on the interface between MSDC and Provisioning Network
Controller (PNC), called MDSC-PNC Interface  (MPI). 
<xref target="RFC8454"/> describes an information model for the Path
Computation request.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Multiple protocol solutions can be used for communication between
different controller hierarchical levels. This document assumes that
the controllers are communicating using YANG-based protocols (e.g.,
NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Path Computation Elements (PCEs), controllers and orchestrators
perform their operations based on Traffic Engineering Databases
(TED). Such TEDs can be described, in a technology agnostic way, with
the YANG data model for TE Topologies <xref target="RFC8795"/>. Furthermore, the
technology specific details of the TED are modelled in the technology
specific topology models, e.g., the <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/> for Optical Transport
Network (OTN) Optical Data Unit (ODU) technologies, which augment the
common TE topology model in <xref target="RFC8795"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The availability of such topology models allows the provisioning of
the TED using YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF).
Furthermore, it enables a PCE/controller performing the necessary
abstractions or modifications and offering this customized topology
to another PCE/controller or high level orchestrator.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The tunnels that can be provided over the networks described with the
topology models can be also set-up, deleted and modified via YANG-
based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF) using the TE tunnel YANG
data model <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
This document defines a YANG data model <xref target="RFC7950"/> that augments the RPC defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>. The use of this RPC is complimentary to the configuration of a TE tunnel path in "compute-only" mode, as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The YANG data model definition does not make any assumption about
whether that the client or the server implement a "PCE"
functionality, as defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>, and the Path Computation
Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) protocol, as defined in
<xref target="RFC5440"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Moreover, this document describes some use cases where a path
computation request, via YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or
RESTCONF), can be needed.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
Management Datastore Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<t>TED:</t>

<ul empty="true"><li>
  <t>The traffic engineering database is a collection of all TE
   information about all TE nodes and TE links in a given network.</t>
</li></ul>

<t>PCE:</t>

<ul empty="true"><li>
  <t>A Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity that is capable of
   computing a network path or route based on a network graph, and of
   applying computational constraints during the computation.  The PCE
   entity is an application that can be located within a network node or
   component, on an out-of-network server, etc.  For example, a PCE
   would be able to compute the path of a TE Label Switched Path (LSP)
   by operating on the TED and considering bandwidth and other
   constraints applicable to the TE LSP service request. <xref target="RFC4655"/>.</t>
</li></ul>

<t>Domain:</t>

<ul empty="true"><li>
  <t>TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links
   that is used in the process of selecting a TE path.  TE information
   is usually only available within a network.  We call such a zone of
   visibility of TE information a domain.  An example of a domain may be
   an IGP area or an Autonomous System. <xref target="RFC7926"/></t>
</li></ul>

<t>The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in

<section anchor="use-cases"><name>Use Cases</name>

<t>This section presents some use cases, where a client needs to request
   underlying SDN controllers for path computation.</t>

<t>The use of the YANG data model defined in this document is not
   restricted to these use cases but can be used in any other use case
   when deemed useful.</t>

<t>The presented uses cases have been grouped, depending on the
   different underlying topologies: Packet/Optical Integration (<xref target="poi-uc"/>);
   multi-domain Traffic Engineered (TE) Networks (<xref target="md-uc"/>); and Data Center
   Interconnections (<xref target="dci-uc"/>). Use cases in <xref target="brpc-uc"/> and <xref target="hpce-uc"/>
   respectively present how to
   apply this YANG data model for standard multi-domain PCE i.e.
   Backward Recursive Path Computation <xref target="RFC5441"/> and Hierarchical PCE
   <xref target="RFC6805"/>.</t>

<section anchor="poi-uc"><name>Packet/Optical Integration</name>

<t>In this use case, an optical domain is used to provide connectivity
   to some nodes of a packet domain (see <xref target="fig-poi-uc"/>).</t>

<t><xref target="fig-poi-uc"/> as well as <xref target="fig-poi-abstraction"/> describe two different
   examples of packet/optical topologies and only show a partial view of the
   packet network connectivity, before additional packet connectivity is
   provided by the optical network.</t>

<t>It is assumed that the Optical Domain Controller provides to the
   Packet/Optical Coordinator an abstracted view of the optical network.
   A possible abstraction could be to represent the whole optical
   network as one "virtual node" with "virtual ports" connected to the
   access links, as shown in <xref target="fig-poi-abstraction"/>.</t>

<t>It is also assumed that Packet Domain Controller can provide the
   Packet/Optical Coordinator the information it needs to set up
   connectivity between packet nodes through the optical network (e.g.,
   the access links).</t>

<t>The path computation request helps the Packet/Optical Coordinator to
   know the real connections that can be provided by the optical
   network.</t>

<t>In this use case, the Packet/Optical Coordinator needs to set up an
   optimal underlying path for an IP link between R1 and R2.</t>

<t>As depicted in <xref target="fig-poi-abstraction"/>, the Packet/Optical Coordinator has only an
   "abstracted view" of the physical network, and it does not know the
   feasibility or the cost of the possible optical paths (e.g., VP1-VP4
   and VP2-VP5), which depend on the current status of the physical
   resources within the optical network and on vendor-specific optical
   attributes.</t>

<t>The Packet/Optical Coordinator can request the underlying Optical
   Domain Controller to compute a set of potential optimal paths, taking
   into account optical constraints. Then, based on its own constraints,
   policy and knowledge (e.g. cost of the access links), it can choose
   which one of these potential paths to use to set up the optimal end-
   to-end path crossing optical network.</t>

<t>For example, in <xref target="fig-poi-example"/>, the Packet/Optical Coordinator can request
   the Optical Domain Controller to compute the paths between VP1-VP4
   and VP2-VP5 and then decide to set up the optimal end-to-end path
   using the VP2-VP5 optical path even if this is not the optimal path
   from the optical domain perspective.</t>

<t>Considering the dynamicity of the connectivity constraints of an
   optical domain, it is possible that a path computed by the Optical
   Domain Controller when requested by the Packet/Optical Coordinator is
   no longer valid/available when the Packet/Optical Coordinator
   requests it to be set up. This is further discussed in <xref target="rpc-motivation"/>.</t>

<t>In order to set up an end-to-end multi-domain TE path (e.g., between
   nodes A and H), the Multi-Domain Controller needs to know the
   feasibility or the cost of the possible TE paths within the two TE
   domains, which depend on the current status of the physical resources
   within each TE domain. This is more challenging in case of optical
   networks because the optimal paths depend also on vendor-specific
   optical attributes (which may be different in the two domains if they
   are provided by different vendors).</t>

<t>In order to set up a multi-domain TE path (e.g., between nodes A and
   H), the Multi-Domain Controller can request the TE Domain Controllers
   to compute a set of intra-domain optimal paths and take decisions
   based on the information received. For example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The Multi-Domain Controller asks TE Domain Controllers to provide
set of paths between A-C, A-D, E-H and F-H</t>
  <t>TE Domain Controllers return a set of feasible paths with the
associated costs: the path A-C is not part of this set (in optical
networks, it is typical to have some paths not being feasible due
to optical constraints that are known only by the Optical Domain
Controller)</t>
  <t>The Multi-Domain Controller will select the path A-D-F-H since it
is the only feasible multi-domain path and then request the TE
Domain Controllers to set up the A-D and F-H intra-domain paths</t>
  <t>If there are multiple feasible paths, the Multi-Domain Controller
can select the optimal path knowing the cost of the intra-domain
paths (provided by the TE domain controllers) and the cost of the
inter-domain links (known by the Multi-Domain Controller)  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
This approach may have some scalability issues when the number of TE
domains is quite big (e.g. 20).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In this case, it would be worthwhile using the abstract TE topology
information provided by the TE Domain Controllers to limit the number
of potential optimal end-to-end paths and then request path
computation from fewer TE Domain Controllers in order to decide what
the optimal path within this limited set is.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>

<section anchor="brpc-uc"><name>Backward Recursive Path Computation scenario</name>

<t><xref target="RFC5441"/> has defined the Virtual Source Path Tree (VSPT) flag within the RP (Request Parameters) object in order to compute inter-domain paths following a
   "Backward Recursive Path Computation" (BRPC) method. The main
   principle is to forward the PCReq message up to the destination
   domain. Then, each PCE involved in the computation will compute its
   part of the path and send it back to the requester through PCE
   Response message. The resulting computation is spread from
   destination PCE to source PCE. Each PCE is in charge of merging the
   path it received with the one it calculated. At the end, the source
   PCE merges its local part of the path with the received one to
   achieve the end-to-end path.</t>

<t>In this use case, a client can use the YANG data model defined in

   the source of the tunnel. For example, a client can request to the
   PCE of domain A to compute a path from a source S, within domain A,
   to a destination D, within domain C. Then PCE of domain A will use

<section anchor="hpce-uc"><name>Hierarchical PCE scenario</name>

<t><xref target="RFC6805"/> has defined an architecture and extensions to the PCE
   standard to compute inter-domain path following a hierarchical
   method. Two new roles have been defined: parent PCE and child PCE.
   The parent PCE is in charge to coordinate the end-to-end path
   computation. For that purpose it sends to each child PCE involved in
   the multi-domain path computation a PCE Request message to obtain the
   local part of the path. Once received all answer through PCE Response
   message, the parent PCE will merge the different local parts of the
   path to achieve the end-to-end path.</t>

<t><xref target="fig-hpce-example"/> below shows a typical hierarchical scenario where a parent
   PCE request end-to-end path to the different child PCE. Note that a
   PCE could take independently the role of child or parent PCE
   depending of which PCE will request the path.</t>

<t>In this use case, a client can use the YANG data model defined in
   this document to request to the parent PCE a path from a source S to
   a destination D. The parent PCE will in turn contact the child PCEs
   through PCEP protocol to compute the end-to-end path and then return
   the computed path to the client, using the YANG data model defined in
   this document. For example the YANG data model can be used to request
   to PCE5 acting as parent PCE to compute a path from source S, within
   domain 1, to destination D, within domain 3. PCE5 will contact child
   PCEs of domain 1, 2 and 3 to obtain local part of the end-to-end path
   through the PCEP protocol. Once received the PCRep message, it
   merges the answers to compute the end-to-end path and send it back to
   the client.</t>

<section anchor="yang-motivation"><name>Motivation for a YANG Model</name>

<section anchor="benefits-of-common-data-models"><name>Benefits of common data models</name>

<t>The YANG data model for requesting path computation is closely
   aligned with the YANG data models that provide (abstract) TE topology
   information, i.e., <xref target="RFC8795"/> as well as that are used to configure
   and manage TE tunnels, i.e., <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>.</t>

<t>There are many benefits in aligning the data model used for path
   computation requests with the YANG data models used for TE topology
   information and for TE tunnels configuration and management:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>There is no need for an error-prone mapping or correlation of
information.</t>
  <t>It is possible to use the same endpoint identifiers in path
computation requests and in the topology modeling.</t>
  <t>The attributes used for path computation constraints are the same
as those used when setting up a TE tunnel.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="benefits-of-a-single-interface"><name>Benefits of a single interface</name>

<t>The system integration effort is typically lower if a single,
   consistent interface is used by controllers, i.e., one data modeling
   language (i.e., YANG) and a common protocol (e.g., NETCONF or
   RESTCONF).</t>

<t>Practical benefits of using a single, consistent interface include:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>Simple authentication and authorization: The interface between
different components has to be secured. If different protocols
have different security mechanisms, ensuring a common access
control model may result in overhead. For instance, there may be a
need to deal with different security mechanisms, e.g., different
credentials or keys. This can result in increased integration
effort.</t>
  <t>Consistency: Keeping data consistent over multiple different
interfaces or protocols is not trivial. For instance, the sequence
of actions can matter in certain use cases, or transaction
semantics could be desired. While ensuring consistency within one
protocol can already be challenging, it is typically cumbersome to
achieve that across different protocols.</t>
  <t>Testing: System integration requires comprehensive testing,
including corner cases. The more different technologies are
involved, the more difficult it is to run comprehensive test cases
and ensure proper integration.</t>
  <t>Middle-box friendliness: Provider and consumer of path computation
requests may be located in different networks, and middle-boxes
such as firewalls, NATs, or load balancers may be deployed. In
such environments it is simpler to deploy a single protocol. Also,
it may be easier to debug connectivity problems.</t>
  <t>Tooling reuse: Implementers may want to implement path computation
requests with tools and libraries that already exist in
controllers and/or orchestrators, e.g., leveraging the rapidly
growing eco-system for YANG tooling.</t>

<section anchor="extensibility"><name>Extensibility</name>

<t>Path computation is only a subset of the typical functionality of a
   controller. In many use cases, issuing path computation requests
   comes along with the need to access other functionality on the same
   system. In addition to obtaining TE topology, for instance also
   configuration of services (set-up/modification/deletion) may be
   required, as well as:</t>

<t><list style="numbers" type="1">
  <t>Receiving notifications for topology changes as well as
integration with fault management</t>
  <t>Performance management such as retrieving monitoring and telemetry
data</t>
  <t>Service assurance, e.g., by triggering OAM functionality</t>
  <t>Other fulfilment and provisioning actions beyond tunnels and
services, such as changing QoS configurations  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
YANG is a very extensible and flexible data modeling language that

<section anchor="topo-interaction"><name>Interactions with TE topology</name>

<t>The use cases described in <xref target="use-cases"/> have been described assuming
   that the topology view exported by each underlying controller to its
   client is aggregated using the "virtual node model", defined in
   <xref target="RFC7926"/>.</t>

<t>TE topology information, e.g., as provided by <xref target="RFC8795"/>, could in
   theory be used by an underlying controller to provide TE information
   to its client thus allowing a PCE available within its client to
   perform multi-domain path computation on its own, without requesting
   path computations to the underlying controllers.</t>

<t>In case the client does not implement a PCE function, as discussed in
   <xref target="intro"/>, it could not perform path computation based on TE topology
   information and would instead need to request path computation from
   the underlying controllers to get the information it needs to find
   the optimal end-to-end path.</t>

<t>In case the client implements a PCE function, as discussed in 
   <xref target="intro"/>, the TE topology information needs to be complete and accurate,
   which would bring to scalability issues.</t>

<t>Using TE topology to provide a "virtual link model" aggregation, as
   described in <xref target="RFC7926"/>, may be insufficient, unless the aggregation
   provides complete and accurate information, which would still cause
   scalability issues, as described in <xref target="topo-aggregation"/> below.</t>

<t>Using TE topology abstraction, as described in <xref target="RFC7926"/>, may lead to
   compute an unfeasible path, as described in <xref target="RFC7926"/> in 
   <xref target="topo-abstraction"/> below.</t>

<t>Therefore when computing an optimal multi-domain path, there is a
   scalability trade-off between providing complete and accurate TE
   information and the number of path computation requests to the
   underlying controllers.</t>

<t>The TE topology information used, in a complimentary way, to reduce
   the number for path computation requests to the underlying
   controllers, are described in <xref target="topo-pc-complement"/> below.</t>

<section anchor="topo-aggregation"><name>TE topology aggregation</name>

<t>Using the TE topology model, as defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, the underlying
   controller can export the whole TE domain as a single TE node with a
   "detailed connectivity matrix" (which provides specific TE
   attributes, such as delay, Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) and other
   TE metrics, between each ingress and egress links).</t>

<t>The information provided by the "detailed connectivity matrix" would
   be equivalent to the information that should be provided by "virtual
   link model" as defined in <xref target="RFC7926"/>.</t>

<t>For example, in the Packet/Optical Integration use case, described in
   <xref target="poi-uc"/>, the Optical Domain Controller can make the information
   shown in <xref target="fig-poi-example"/> available to the Packet/Optical Coordinator as part
   of the TE topology information and the Packet/Optical Coordinator
   could use this information to calculate on its own the optimal path
   between R1 and R2, without requesting any additional information to
   the Optical Domain Controller.</t>

<t>However, when designing the amount of information to provide within
   the "detailed connectivity matrix", there is a tradeoff to be
   considered between accuracy (i.e., providing "all" the information
   that might be needed by the PCE available within the client) and
   scalability.</t>

<t><xref target="poi-multi-path"/> below shows another example, similar to <xref target="fig-poi-example"/>, where
   there are two possible Optical paths between VP1 and VP4 with
   different properties (e.g., available bandwidth and cost).</t>

<t>If the information in the "detailed connectivity matrix" is not
   complete/accurate, we can have the following drawbacks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If only the VP1-VP4 path with available bandwidth of 2 Gb/s and
cost 50 is reported, the client's PCE will fail to compute a 5
Gb/s path between routers R1 and R2, although this would be
feasible;</t>
  <t>If only the VP1-VP4 path with available bandwidth of 10 Gb/s and
cost 65 is reported, the client's PCE will compute, as optimal,
the 1 Gb/s path between R1 and R2 going through the VP2-VP5 path
within the optical domain while the optimal path would actually be
the one going thought the VP1-VP4 sub-path (with cost 50) within
the optical domain.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Reporting all the information, as in <xref target="poi-multi-path"/>, using the "detailed
 connectivity matrix", is quite challenging from a scalability
 perspective. The amount of this information is not just based on
 number of end points (which would scale as N-square), but also on
 many other parameters, including client rate, user
 constraints/policies for the service, e.g. max latency &lt; N ms, max
 cost, etc., exclusion policies to route around busy links, min
 Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) margin, max pre-Forward Error
 Correction (FEC) Bit Error Rate (BER) etc. All these constraints
 could be different based on connectivity requirements.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
It is also worth noting that the "connectivity matrix" has been
 originally defined in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON),
 <xref target="RFC7446"/>, to report the connectivity constrains of a physical node
 within the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) network: the
 information it contains is pretty "static" and therefore, once taken
 and stored in the TE data base, it can be always being considered
 valid and up-to-date in path computation request.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The "connectivity matrix" is sometimes confused with "optical reach
 table" that contain multiple (e.g. k-shortest) regen-free reachable
 paths for every A-Z node combination in the network. Optical reach
 tables can be calculated offline, utilizing vendor optical design and
 planning tools, and periodically uploaded to the Controller: these
 optical path reach tables are fairly static. However, to get the
 connectivity matrix, between any two sites, either a regen free path
 can be used, if one is available, or multiple regen free paths are
 concatenated to get from the source to the destination, which can be
 a very large combination. Additionally, when the optical path within
 optical domain needs to be computed, it can result in different paths
 based on input objective, constraints, and network conditions. In
 summary, even though "optical reach table" is fairly static, which
 regen free paths to build the connectivity matrix between any source
 and destination is very dynamic, and is done using very sophisticated
 routing algorithms.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Using the "basic connectivity matrix" with an abstract node to
 abstract the information regarding the connectivity constraints of an
 Optical domain, would make this information more "dynamic" since the
 connectivity constraints of an optical domain can change over time
 because some optical paths that are feasible at a given time may
 become unfeasible at a later time when e.g., another optical path is
 established.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The information in the "detailed connectivity matrix" is even more
 dynamic since the establishment of another optical path may change
 some of the parameters (e.g., delay or available bandwidth) in the
 "detailed connectivity matrix" while not changing the feasibility of
 the path.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
There is therefore the need to keep the information in the "detailed
 connectivity matrix" updated which means that there another tradeoff
 between the accuracy (i.e., providing "all" the information that
 might be needed by the client's PCE) and having up-to-date
 information. The more the information is provided and the longer it
 takes to keep it up-to-date which increases the likelihood that the
 client's PCE computes paths using not updated information.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
It seems therefore quite challenging to have a "detailed connectivity
 matrix" that provides accurate, scalable and updated information to
 allow the client's PCE to take optimal decisions by its own.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Considering the example in <xref target="poi-multi-path"/> with the approach defined in this
 document, the client, when it needs to set up an end-to-end path, it
 can request the Optical Domain Controller to compute a set of optimal
 paths (e.g., for VP1-VP4 and VP2-VP5) and take decisions based on the
 information received:</t>
  <t>When setting up a 5 Gb/s path between routers R1 and R2, the
Optical Domain Controller may report only the VP1-VP4 path as the
only feasible path: the Packet/Optical Coordinator can
successfully set up the end-to-end path passing though this
optical path;</t>
  <t>When setting up a 1 Gb/s path between routers R1 and R2, the
Optical Domain Controller (knowing that the path requires only 1
Gb/s) can report both the VP1-VP4 path, with cost 50, and the VP2-
VP5 path, with cost 65. The Packet/Optical Coordinator can then
compute the optimal path which is passing thought the VP1-VP4 sub-
path (with cost 50) within the optical domain.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="topo-abstraction"><name>TE topology abstraction</name>

<t>Using the TE topology model, as defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, the underlying
   controller can export to its client an abstract TE topology, composed
   by a set of TE nodes and TE links, representing the abstract view of
   the topology under its control.</t>

<t>For example, in the multi-domain TE network use case, described in
   <xref target="md-uc"/>, the TE Domain Controller 1 can export a TE topology
   encompassing the TE nodes A, B, C and D and the TE links
   interconnecting them. In a similar way, the TE Domain Controller 2
   can export a TE topology encompassing the TE nodes E, F, G and H and
   the TE links interconnecting them.</t>

<t>In this example, for simplicity reasons, each abstract TE node maps
   with each physical node, but this is not necessary.</t>

<t>In order to set up a multi-domain TE path (e.g., between nodes A and
   H), the Multi-Domain Controller can compute by its own an optimal
   end-to-end path based on the abstract TE topology information
   provided by the domain controllers. For example:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Multi-Domain Controller can compute, based on its own TED data,
the optimal multi-domain path being A-B-C-E-G-H, and then request
the TE Domain Controllers to set up the A-B-C and E-G-H intra-
domain paths</t>
  <t>But, during path set-up, the TE Domain Controller may find out
that A-B-C intra-domain path is not feasible (as discussed in
<xref target="md-uc"/>, in optical networks it is typical to have some paths
not being feasible due to optical constraints that are known only
by the Optical Domain Controller), while only the path A-B-D is
feasible</t>
  <t>So what the Multi-Domain Controller has computed is not good and
it needs to re-start the path computation from scratch  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
As discussed in <xref target="topo-aggregation"/>, providing more extensive abstract
information from the TE Domain Controllers to the Multi-Domain
Controller may lead to scalability problems.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In a sense this is similar to the problem of routing and wavelength
assignment within an optical domain. It is possible to do first
routing (step 1) and then wavelength assignment (step 2), but the
chances of ending up with a good path is low. Alternatively, it is
possible to do combined routing and wavelength assignment, which is
known to be a more optimal and effective way for optical path set-up.
Similarly, it is possible to first compute an abstract end-to-end
path within the Multi-Domain Controller (step 1) and then compute an
intra-domain path within each optical domain (step 2), but there are
more chances not to find a path or to get a suboptimal path than by
performing multiple per-domain path computations and then stitching
them together.</t>

<section anchor="topo-pc-complement"><name>Complementary use of the TE topology</name>

<t>As discussed in <xref target="md-uc"/>, there are some scalability issues with
   path computation requests in a multi-domain TE network with many TE
   domains, in terms of the number of requests to send to the TE Domain
   Controllers. It would therefore be worthwhile using the abstract TE
   topology information provided by the TE Domain Controllers to limit
   the number of requests.</t>

<t>An example can be described considering the multi-domain abstract TE
   topology shown in <xref target="fig-topo-many-domains"/>. In this example, an end-to-end TE path
   between domains A and F needs to be set up. The transit TE domain
   should be selected between domains B, C, D and E.</t>

<t>The actual cost of each intra-domain path is not known a priori from
   the abstract topology information. The Multi-Domain Controller only
   knows, from the TE topology provided by the underlying domain
   controllers, the feasibility of some intra-domain paths and some
   upper-bound and/or lower-bound cost information. With this
   information, together with the cost of inter-domain links, the Multi-
   Domain Controller can understand by its own that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Domain B cannot be selected as the path connecting domains A and F
is not feasible;</t>
  <t>Domain E cannot be selected as a transit domain since it is known
from the abstract topology information provided by domain
controllers that the cost of the multi-domain path A-E-F (which is
100, in the best case) will be always be higher than the cost of
the multi-domain paths A-D-F (which is 90, in the worst case) and
A-C-F (which is 80, in the worst case).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Therefore, the Multi-Domain Controller can understand by its own that
 the optimal multi-domain path could be either A-D-F or A-C-F but it
 cannot know which one of the two possible option actually provides
 the optimal end-to-end path.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The Multi-Domain Controller can therefore request path computation
 only to the TE Domain Controllers A, D, C and F (and not to all the
 possible TE Domain Controllers).</t>

<t>Based on these requests, the Multi-Domain Controller can know the
   actual cost of each intra-domain paths which belongs to potential
   optimal end-to-end paths, as shown in <xref target="fig-pc-many-domains"/>, and then compute the
   optimal end-to-end path (e.g., A-D-F, having total cost of 50,
   instead of A-C-F having a total cost of 70).</t>

<section anchor="rpc-motivation"><name>Path Computation RPC</name>

<t>The TE tunnel YANG data model, defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>, can support
   the need to request path computation, as described in section 5.1.2
   of <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>.</t>

<t>This solution is stateful since the state of each created "compute-
   only" TE tunnel path needs to be maintained, in the YANG datastores
   (at least in the running datastore and operational datastore), and
   updated, when underlying network conditions change.</t>

<t>The RPC mechanism allows requesting path computation using a simple
   atomic operation, without creating any state in the YANG datastores,
   and it is the natural option/choice, especially with stateless PCE.</t>

<t>It is very useful to provide both the options of using an RPC as well
   as of setting up TE tunnel paths in "compute-only" mode. It is
   suggested to use the RPC as much as possible and to rely on
   "compute-only" TE tunnel paths, when really needed.</t>

<t>Using the RPC solution would imply that the underlying controller
   (e.g., a PNC) computes a path twice during the process to set up an
   LSP: at time T1, when its client (e.g., an MDSC) sends a path
   computation RPC request to it, and later, at time T2, when the same
   client (MDSC) creates a TE tunnel requesting the set-up of the LSP.
   The underlying assumption is that, if network conditions have not
   changed, the same path that has been computed at time T1 is also
   computed at time T2 by the underlying controller (e.g. PNC) and
   therefore the path that is set up at time T2 is exactly the same path
   that has been computed at time T1.</t>

<t>However, since the operation is stateless, there is no guarantee that
   the returned path would still be available when path set-up is
   requested: this does not cause major issues when the time between
   path computation and path set-up is short (especially if compared
   with the time that would be needed to update the information of a
   very detailed connectivity matrix).</t>

<t>In most of the cases, there is even no need to guarantee that the
   path that has been set up is the exactly same as the path that has
   been returned by path computation, especially if it has the same or
   even better metrics. Depending on the abstraction level applied by
   the server, the client may also not know the actual computed path.</t>

<t>The most important requirement is that the required global objectives
   (e.g., multi-domain path metrics and constraints) are met. For this
   reason a path verification phase is always necessary to verify that
   the actual path that has been set up meets the global objectives (for
   example in a multi-domain network, the resulting end-to-end path
   meets the required end-to-end metrics and constraints).</t>

<t>In most of the cases, even if the path being set up is not exactly
   the same as the path returned by path computation, its metrics and
   constraints are "good enough" and the path verification passes
   successfully. In the few corner cases where the path verification
   fails, it is possible repeat the whole process (path computation,
   path set-up and path verification).</t>

<t>In case it is required to set up at T2 exactly the same path computed
   at T1, the RPC solution should not be used and, instead, a "compute-
   only" TE tunnel path should be set up, allowing also notifications in
   case the computed path has been changed.</t>

<t>In this case, at time T1, the client (MDSC) creates a TE tunnel in a
   compute-only mode in the running datastore and later, at time T2,
   changes the configuration of that TE tunnel (not to be any more in a
   compute-only mode) to trigger the set-up of the LSP over the path
   which have been computed at time T1 and reported in the operational
   datastore.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that also using the "compute-only" TE tunnel path,
   although increasing the likelihood that the computed path is
   available at path set-up, does not guarantee that because
   notifications may not be reliable or delivered on time. Path
   verification is needed also in this case.</t>

<t>The solution based on "compute-only" TE tunnel path has also the
   following drawbacks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Several messages required for any path computation</t>
  <t>Requires persistent storage in the underlying controller</t>
  <t>Need for garbage collection for stranded paths</t>
  <t>Process burden to detect changes on the computed paths in order to
provide notifications update</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="temp-state"><name>Temporary reporting of the computed path state</name>

<t>This section describes an optional extension to the stateless
   behavior of the path computation RPC, where the underlying
   controller, after having received a path computation RPC request,
   maintains some "transient state" associated with the computed path,
   allowing the client to request the set-up of exactly that path, if
   still available.</t>

<t>This is similar to the "compute-only" TE tunnel path solution but, to
   avoid the drawbacks of the stateful approach, is leveraging the path
   computation RPC and the separation between configuration and
   operational datastore, as defined in the NMDA architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<t>The underlying controller, after having computed a path, as requested
   by a path computation RPC, also creates a TE tunnel instance within
   the operational datastore, to store that computed path. This would be
   similar to a "compute-only" TE tunnel path, with the only difference
   that there is no associated TE tunnel instance within the running
   datastore.</t>

<t>Since the underlying controller stores in the operational datastore
   the computed path based on an abstract topology it exposes, it also
   remembers, internally, which is the actual native path (physical
   path), within its native topology (physical topology), associated
   with that compute-only TE tunnel instance.</t>

<t>Afterwards, the client (e.g., MDSC) can request the set-up of that
   specific path by creating a TE tunnel instance (not in compute-only
   mode) in the running datastore using the same tunnel-name of
   the existing TE tunnel in the operational datastore: this will
   trigger the underlying controller to set up that path, if still
   available.</t>

<t>There are still cases where the path being set up is not exactly the
   same as the path that has been computed:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>When the tunnel is configured with path constraints which are not
compatible with the computed path;</t>
  <t>When the tunnel set-up is requested after the resources of the
computed path are no longer available;</t>
  <t>When the tunnel set-up is requested after the computed path is no
longer known (e.g. due to a server reboot) by the underlying
controller.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In all these cases, the underlying controller should compute and set
 up a new path.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Therefore the "path verification" phase, as described in <xref target="rpc-motivation"/>
 above, is always needed to check that the path that has been set up
 is still "good enough".  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Since this new approach is not completely stateless, garbage
 collection is implemented using a timeout that, when it expires,
 triggers the removal of the computed path from the operational
 datastore. This operation is fully controlled by the underlying
 controller without the need for any action to be taken by the client
 that is not able to act on the operational datastore. The default
 value of this timeout is 10 minutes but a different value may be
 configured by the client.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In addition, it is possible for the client to tag each path
 computation request with a transaction-id allowing for a faster
 removal of all the paths associated with a transaction-id, without
 waiting for their timers to expire.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The underlying controller can remove from the operational datastore
 all the paths computed with a given transaction-id which have not
 been set up either when it receives a Path Delete RPC request for
 that transaction-id or, automatically, right after the set-up up of a
 path that has been previously computed with that transaction-id.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
This possibility is useful when multiple paths are computed but, at
 most, only one is set up (e.g., in multi-domain path computation
 scenario scenarios). After the selected path has been set up (e.g, in
 one domain during multi-domain path set-up), all the other
 alternative computed paths can be automatically deleted by the
 underlying controller (since no longer needed). The client can also
 request, using the Path Delete RPC request, the underlying controller
 to remove all the computed paths, if none of them is going to be set
 up (e.g., in a transit domain not being selected by multi-domain path
 computation and so not being automatically deleted).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
This approach is complimentary and not alternative to the timer which
 is always needed to avoid stranded computed paths being stored in the
 operational datastore when no path is set up and no explicit Path
 Delete RPC request is received.</t>

<section anchor="path-computation-and-optimization-for-multiple-paths"><name>Path computation and optimization for multiple paths</name>

<t>There are use cases, where it is advantageous to request path
   computation for a set of paths, through a network or through a
   network domain, using a single request <xref target="RFC5440"/>.</t>

<t>In this case, sending a single request for multiple path
   computations, instead of sending multiple requests for each path
   computation, would reduce the protocol overhead and it would consume
   less resources (e.g., threads in the client and server).</t>

<t>In the context of a typical multi-domain TE network, there could
   multiple choices for the ingress/egress points of a domain and the
   Multi-Domain Controller needs to request path computation between all
   the ingress/egress pairs to select the best pair. For example, in the
   example of <xref target="md-uc"/>, the Multi-Domain Controller needs to request
   the TE Network Controller 1 to compute the A-C and the A-D paths and
   to the TE Network Controller 2 to compute the E-H and the F-H paths.</t>

<t>It is also possible that the Multi-Domain Controller receives a
   request to set up a group of multiple end to end connections. The
   Multi-Domain Controller needs to request each TE domain Controller to
   compute multiple paths, one (or more) for each end to end connection.</t>

<t>There are also scenarios where it can be needed to request path
   computation for a set of paths in a synchronized fashion.</t>

<t>One example could be computing multiple diverse paths. Computing a
   set of diverse paths in an unsynchronized fashion, leads to the
   possibility of not being able to satisfy the diversity requirement.
   In this case, it is preferable to compute a sub-optimal primary path
   for which a diversely routed secondary path exists.</t>

<t>There are also scenarios where it is needed to request optimizing a
   set of paths using objective functions that apply to the whole set of
   paths, see <xref target="RFC5541"/>, e.g. to minimize the sum of the costs of all
   the computed paths in the set.</t>

<t>This document define a YANG RPC to request path computation as an
   "augmentation" of tunnel-rpc, defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>. This model
   provides the RPC input attributes that are needed to request path
   computation and the RPC output attributes that are needed to report
   the computed paths.</t>

<t>It also allows the client to request which information (metrics, SRLG
   and/or affinities) should be returned:</t>

<t>This feature is essential for path computation in a multi-domain TE
   network as described in <xref target="md-uc"/>. In this case, the metrics
   returned by a path computation requested to a given underlying
   controller must be used by the client to compute the best end-to-end
   path. If they are missing, the client cannot compare different paths
   calculated by the underlying controllers and choose the best one for
   the optimal end-to-end (e2e) path.</t>

<section anchor="multiple-paths-requests-for-the-same-te-tunnel"><name>Multiple Paths Requests for the same TE tunnel</name>

<t>The YANG data model allows including multiple requests for different
   paths intended to be used within the same tunnel or within different
   tunnels.</t>

<t>When multiple requested paths are intended to be used within the same
   tunnel (e.g., requesting path computation for the primary and
   secondary paths of a protected tunnel), the set of attributes that
   are intended to be configured on per-tunnel basis rather than on per-
   path basis are common to all these path requests. These attributes
   includes both attributes which can be configured only a per-tunnel
   basis (e.g., tunnel-name, source/destination TTP, encoding and
   switching-type) as well attributes which can be configured both on a
   per-tunnel and on a per-path basis (e.g., the te-bandwidth or the
   associations).</t>

<t>Therefore, a tunnel-attributes list is defined, within the path
   computation request RPC:</t>

<t>The path requests that are intended to be used within the same tunnel
   should reference the same entry in the tunnel-attributes list. This
   allows:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>avoiding repeating the same set of per-tunnel parameters on
multiple requested paths;</t>
  <t>the server to understand what attributes are intended to be
configured on a per-tunnel basis (e.g., the te-bandwidth
configured in the tunnel-attributes) and what attributes are
intended to be configured on a per-path basis(e.g., the te-
bandwidth configured in the path-request). This could be useful
especially when the server also creates a TE tunnel instance
within the operational datastore to report the computed paths, as
described in <xref target="temp-state"/>: in this case, the tunnel-name is also
used as the suggested name for that TE tunnel instance.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The YANG data model allows also including requests for paths intended
 to modify existing tunnels (e.g., adding a protection path for an
 existing un-protected tunnel). In this case, the per-tunnel
 attributes are already provided in an existing TE tunnel instance and
 do not need to be re-configured in the path computation request RPC.
 Therefore, these requests should reference an existing TE tunnel
 instance.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
It is also possible to request computing paths without indicating in
 which tunnel they are intended to be used (e.g., in case of an
 unprotected tunnel). In this case, the per-tunnel attributes could be
 provided together with the per-path attributes in the path request,
 without using the tunnel-attributes list.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The choices below are defined to distinguish the cases above:</t>
  <t>whether the per-tunnel attributes are configured by reference
(providing a leafref), to:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>either a TE tunnel instance, if it exists;</t>
      <t>or to an entry of the tunnel-attributes list, if the TE tunnel
instance does not exist;</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>or by value, providing the set of tunnel attributes within the
path request:</t>

<t>The (value) case provides the set of attributes that are configured

<t>In this case, it is assumed that the requested path will be the only

<t>If the only path within a tunnel is the transit segment of a multi-domain end-to-end path, it can be of any type (primary, secondary, reverse-primary
   or reverse-secondary). The (path-role) choice is used to specify its role in the path request:</t>

<t>In all the other cases, the only path within a tunnel is a primary path.</t>

<t>The secondary-path, the primary-reverse-path and the secondary-
   reverse-path are presence container used to indicate the role of the
   path: by default, the path is assumed to be a primary path.</t>

<t>They optionally can contain the name of the primary-path under which
   the requested path could be associated within the YANG tree structure
   defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>, which could be useful when the server also
   creates a TE tunnel instance within the operational datastore to

<t>In order to indicate the role of the path being requested within the

<t>The secondary-path container can also contain some attributes which

<t>The primary-reverse-path container indicates that the requested path

<t>The secondary-reverse-path container indicates that the requested

<t>In case the requested path is a transit segment of a multi-domain

   setup/computed. However, the request for path computation of a

   requires that the primary-path exists or it is requested within the
   same RPC request. In the latter case, the path request for the
   primary-path should have an empty 'route-object-include-exclude' list,
   as described in section 5.1.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>, to indicate to the server that
   path computation is not requested and no path properties will
   therefore be returned in the RPC response.</t>

<t>The tunnel-attributes of a given client-layer path request can
   reference server-layer TE tunnels which can already exist in the YANG
   datastore or be specified in the tunnel-attributes list, within the
   same RPC request:</t>

<t>In a similar way as in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>, the server-layer tunnel
   attributes should provide the information of what would be the
   dynamic link in the client layer topology supported by that tunnel,
   if instantiated:</t>

<t>It is worth noting that since path computation RPC is stateless, the
   dynamic hierarchical links configured for the server-layer tunnel
   attributes cannot be used for path computation of any client-layer
   path unless explicitly referenced in the dependency-tunnel-attributes
   list within the same RPC request.</t>

<t>This document describes use cases of requesting Path Computation
   using YANG data models, which could be used at the ABNO Control
   Interface <xref target="RFC7491"/> and/or between controllers in ACTN <xref target="RFC8453"/>. As
   such, it does not introduce any new security considerations compared
   to the ones related to YANG specification, ABNO specification and
   ACTN Framework defined in <xref target="RFC7950"/>, <xref target="RFC7491"/> and <xref target="RFC8453"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF protocol <xref target="RFC8040"/>. The
   lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) 
   <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.</t>

<t>The YANG module defined in this document augments the "tunnels-path-compute" and the "tunnel-actions" RPCs defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>. The security considerations provided in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/> are also applicable to the YANG module
   defined in this document.</t>

<t>The RPC defined in this document can also be used for Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The security considerations defines in section 10.7.2 of <xref target="RFC5440"/> also applies to the use of this RPC.</t>

<t>The definition of the input shaping/policing mechanisms and of their configuration is outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Some of the RPC operations defined in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations. These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

<t>"te-pc:response/computed-paths-properties": provides the same information provided by the "te:computed-paths-properties" defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>. The security considerations provided in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/> for the TE tunnel state apply also to this subtree.</t>

<t>"te-pc:response/te-pc:tunnel-ref", "te-pc:response/te-pc:primary-path-ref", "te-pc:response/te-pc:primary-reverse-path-ref", "te-pc:response/te-pc:secondary-path-ref" and "te-pc:response/te-pc:secondary-reverse-path-ref" provides a reference where the same information provided in "te-pc:response/computed-paths-properties" is temporarly stored with the operational datastore (see <xref target="temp-state"/>). Therefore access to this information does not provide any additional security issue that the information provided with "te-pc:response/computed-paths-properties".</t>

<t>"/te:tunnels-actions": the YANG model defined in this document augments this action with a new action type that allows deleting the transient states of computed paths (see <xref target="temp-state"/>). A malicious use of this action would have no impact on the paths carrying live traffic but it would preclude the client from using the "transient states" to request the set-up of exactly that path, if still available.</t>

<t>The security considerations spelled out in the
   YANG specification <xref target="RFC7950"/> apply for this document as well.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. TE information is usually only available within a network. We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</t>
      <t>In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network. This need not be the full set of TE information available within each network but does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</t>
      <t>This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement. For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</t>

      <t>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement. In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems. This document specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter-domain shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward-recursive path computation technique. This technique preserves confidentiality across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different service providers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks is subject to a set of one or more specific optimization criteria, referred to as objective functions (e.g., minimum cost path, widest path, etc.).</t>
      <t>In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path Computation Client (PCC) may want a path to be computed for one or more TE LSPs according to a specific objective function. Thus, the PCC needs to instruct the PCE to use the correct objective function. Furthermore, it is possible that not all PCEs support the same set of objective functions; therefore, it is useful for the PCC to be able to automatically discover the set of objective functions supported by each PCE.</t>
      <t>This document defines extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate the set of objective functions it supports. Extensions are also defined so that a PCC can indicate in a path computation request the required objective function, and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the objective function that was used for path computation.</t>
      <t>This document defines objective function code types for six objective functions previously listed in the PCE requirements work, and provides the definition of four new metric types that apply to a set of synchronized requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

      <t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.

    <abstract>
      <t>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks is complex and may require special computational components and cooperation between the different network domains.</t>
      <t>This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space. This document does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components, but rather it describes a set of building blocks for the PCE architecture from which solutions may be constructed. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

    <title>The Application of the Path Computation Element Architecture to the Determination of a Sequence of Domains in MPLS and GMPLS</title>

    <abstract>
      <t>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS networks presents a problem because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.</t>
      <t>Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are simply connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. Where there are multiple connections between domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) procedure can be used to derive an optimal path.</t>
      <t>This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship between domains. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>

      <t>This document provides a model of information needed by the Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) process in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs). The purpose of the information described in this model is to facilitate constrained optical path computation in WSONs. This model takes into account compatibility constraints between WSON signal attributes and network elements but does not include constraints due to optical impairments. Aspects of this information that may be of use to other technologies utilizing a GMPLS control plane are discussed.</t>

<t>The authors would like to thank Karthik Sethuraman, Igor Bryskin and Xian Zhang for
participating in the initial discussions that have triggered this
work and providing valuable insights.</t>

<t>The authors would like to thank the authors of the TE tunnel YANG
data model <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>, in particular Igor Bryskin, Vishnu Pavan
Beeram, Tarek Saad and Xufeng Liu, for their inputs to the
discussions and support in having consistency between the Path
Computation and TE tunnel YANG data models.</t>

<t>The authors would like to thank Adrian Farrel, Dhruv Dhody, Igor
Bryskin, Julien Meuric and Lou Berger for their valuable input to the
discussions that has clarified that the path being set up is not
necessarily the same as the path that has been previously computed
and, in particular to Dhruv Dhody, for his suggestion to describe the
need for a path verification phase to check that the actual path
being set up meets the required end-to-end metrics and constraints.</t>

<t>The authors would like to thank Aihua Guo, Lou Berger, Shaolong Gan,
Martin Bjorklund and Tom Petch for their useful comments on how to
define XPath statements in YANG RPCs.</t>
